As the [class guide](https://61040-fa22.github.io/about/) says, this class includes an optional design reading group. A new book, [*The Essence of Software*](https://essenceofsoftware.com/), on which much of the class material is based, is a *recommended* but not required text. You can get the hardcover book from the [MIT library](https://mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01MIT_INST/1jdn9l1/alma9935198666906761) and you can also download [individual chapters](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.mit.edu/stable/j.ctv1nj340p).

For students interested in delving more deeply into the ideas of the class, Daniel Jackson will host an optional weekly discussion group about software design based on assigned readings mostly from the book. Pizza will be served.

The reading group meets weekly on Thursdays from 5 to 6 pm, starting September 8th and running through November 3rd. The location will be 32-370 every week except Sep 15, which will be 32-G575, and Sep 29, which will be 32-D507.

Please fill out this RSVP form each week that you plan to attend if you would like pizza: [https://tiny.cc/61040-fa22-pizza](https://forms.gle/TU39L7CWMbueub7e8).

This schedule indicates which chapters of *The Essence of Software* will be discussed at each reading group meeting. The first chapter is a short and easy reading, and you can download it [here](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/sample-chapter/).
