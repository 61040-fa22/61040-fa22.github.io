<!--
Twitter, the social networking platform, has fallen on hard times. It has [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/twitter-twtr-q4-2021-earnings.html) for user growth and revenue, has [struggled to ship](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22970043/twitter-product-leadership-interview) compelling new features for several years, and has a [problematic track record](https://wapo.st/3KhcFdP) of protecting user security and privacy. 

As an intrepid new designer, you sense an opportunity for a new app that you call _Fritter_ — a web service for frittering your time away, that clones the best parts of Twitter and extends it in exciting new ways. But before you get deep into designing and coding Fritter, you want to make sure that your hunch is well-grounded in user needs, and that it won't suffer from the same social and ethical problems.

**Purpose:** This assignment will give you experience with (a) conducting needfinding interviews, and (b) thinking through ethical design considerations following the [Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework](http://www.envisioningcards.com).

**Reminders**. Make sure you have read and understood the rules for collaboration, submission and slack days.

## Your Tasks

1. VSD provides [4 dimensions (or criteria)](http://www.envisioningcards.com/?page_id=2#1) for analyzing designs: **stakeholders**, or the direct and indirect people who may be impacted by the technological design you're envisioning; **time**, or thinking through the short, medium, and long term implications of your design; **values**, or how your design affects what people consider to be important with respect to autonomy, a sense of community, democratic expression, inclusion, fairness, etc.; and, **pervasiveness**, or what the systemtic interactions may occur if your design is broadly adopted. For each of these criteria, VSD offers a [series of prompts](http://www.envisioningcards.com/?page_id=7) to spur your analysis.  

    **For each of the 4 dimensions, pick 2 prompts and apply them to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of Twitter as it exists today, and opportunities they suggest for your app, Fritter.** For instance, what challenges might someone experience when a Twitter account needs to change hands? Or, how might Twitter grapple with crossing national boundaries (e.g., [complying with takedown notices](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/05/twitter-sues-india-government/) issued by governments)? **Document your analysis** in a manner that fits the prompt. This may include a richly annotated screenshot of relevant user interface elements, narrating over a short screen recording, and/or a brief (~150 word) written paragraph. 
    
2. Augment your VSD analysis by conducting **two interviews** with people who use Twitter or other social networking platforms (e.g., Twitch, Snapchat, TikTok, etc.). Each interview should last 30 to 45 minutes, and should explore topics such as: how people use these platforms in their daily life; what benefits they get from them; what they enjoy about their interactions with the platforms;  where these platforms fall short. 

    **Before conducting the interviews**, brainstorm a set of questions you are interested in covering, and develop a strategy for taking notes (we offer some advice on both of these aspects in the section below). Include your interview script and notes as part of your final deliverable on your Jekyll site.

    For each interview, write a **two paragraph report** that summarizes the highlights of the interview (anecdotes your subject related, unusual observations, etc.). Follow this summary up with a **one to two paragraph reflection** that synthesizes what you learned from the interview (for example, what was surprising or unexpected, how the interview informed your future design).
    

## Rubric

The teaching staff will grade your assignment using the following rubric. This assignment is worth 10 points, and submissions that squarely meet the expectations (i.e., the _Satisfactory_ column) will be awarded 7.5 points, which roughly maps to a B letter grade. Note: individual rubric cells may not may to specific point values.

| Component | Excellent | Satisfactory | Poor
| ----- | ----- |----- |----- |
| **VSD: Stakeholders**|||
| **VSD: Time**|||
| **VSD: Values**|||
| **VSD: Pervasiveness**|||
| **Interviews: Script**|Breadth + depth. Anticipates some follow-ups.|Explores a nice diversity of questions, but misses some opportunities for follow-ups or to explore new topic areas. Occasionally expects participants to be a designer.|Frequently expects participants to be a designer.
| **Interviews: Notes**|Rich detailed notes.||
| **Interviews: Report**|||
| **Interviews: Synthesis**|||Rambling.

[Something about consistent grading to allay student concerns about grading being qualitative ("subjective").]

## Advice

(Rough draft, needs to be polished)
1. Don't underestimate how long it takes to do the VSD analysis. In subsequent assignments, you will begin to design and implement Fritter. So, investing time now will yield dividends later. At minimum, we anticipate that you will need to spend 30–45 minutes with each prompt to be able to conduct a sufficiently compelling design analysis.
2. Doing a good VSD analysis will require more than just thinking really hard about the criteria and prompt. Make sure you spend time really using Twitter to deeply understand how it works. Augment your thinking by doing some research around the prompt. For instance, are there news articles (e.g., on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com), or the tech columns of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology) or [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/news/technology)) that are relevant to one of the prompts? 
3. During your interviews, remember that your participants are not designers themselves. So directed questions like _"Why do you use Twitter?"_ or _"What feature would keep you more engaged on Twitter?"_ are unlikely to yield very interesting answers. Instead, keep your participants focused on describing their experiences using Twitter or other social networking platforms (e.g., have them recount stories about how and when they use them). 
4. Semi-structured: before conducting an interview, brainstorm a set of questions you're interested in hearing more about. Use these questions to spark a conversation, and guide the interview. But also follow your own instincts during the conversation — for example, if the participant is recounting something interesting, feel free to ask follow-up questions rather than rigidly following your list of questions. The goal of the interviews is to discover interesting, unexpected insights that you may not have thought of by yourself.
5. Take detailed notes. It can be tricky to do this in the moment while still being engaged in the conversation. So, one option you might consider is recording the audio of your conversation. If you choose to do this, **you must solicit written consent from participants**. After the interview, you can then listen to the recording and take notes about things that stick out.
