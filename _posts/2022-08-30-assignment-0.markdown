# "Assignment" 0: Creating a Personal Website using Jekyll

Your first "assignment" for 6.1040 is to create a minimal personal website that you will use to submit assignments for this class. To do this, you will use a static site generator called Jekyll. 

**Purpose:** This is an *ungraded* assignment, but the website you create will be the platform for your future submissions in this class. Also, by publishing your work on a website (rather than a less permanent medium like Canvas), you can use continue to use your site as a personal portfolio beyond this class. We have purposefully left the assignment specifications relatively open-ended so that you are free to make your website your own.


## Your Tasks

1. Read [this introduction to website builders like Jekyll](https://hackmd.io/lHLVON-TR06T1F2PlqAZzQ) to familiarize with the concepts that power Jekyll. [TODO: replace link with website link instead of hackmd link]
2.  Complete all sections of [this Jekyll installation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fmutMEHFMKh15WmDqWd0oqi82sIeid9DjB95oUBjAUw/edit#). By the end of the guide, you should have created and deployed your site!
3. On your new site, edit the "About" page (the file `about.markdown`) to be about you â€“ include a short blurb about yourself and a headshot if you would like.
4. Make a new post (in the `_posts` directory) about what you hope to take away from or experience in 6.1040 this semester.
5. Replace the placeholder text in the title, footer, etc. of the website (hint: see `_config.yml`). Feel free to play around with the theme and customize your website to make it your own!


## Submission

For this assignment only, you will submit your website URL on Canvas. [TODO: link]. For future assignments, there will be no explicit submission process, and TAs will revisit your URL to find your work. For more information on the submission process, please see the class guide. [TODO: link]
