# "Assignment" 0: Creating a Personal Website using Jekyll

Your first "assignment" for 6.1040 is to create a minimal personal website that you will use to submit assignments for this class. To do this, you will use a static site generator called Jekyll. 

**Purpose:** This is an *ungraded* assignment, but the website you create will be the platform for your future submissions in this class. Also, by publishing your work on a website (rather than a less permanent medium like Canvas), you can use continue to use your site as a personal portfolio beyond this class. We have purposefully left the assignment specifications relatively open-ended so that you are free to make your website your own.


## Your Tasks
1. Set up Jekyll on your machine. (You can follow Part 1 the Jekyll installation guide linked below.)
4. Create a bare-bones static website using Jekyll (part 2 of the guide).
5. Deploy your website to GitHub pages (part 3 of the guide).
6. On your new site, edit the "About" page (the file `about.markdown`) to be about you â€“ include a short blurb about yourself and a headshot if you would like.
7. Make a short post (in the `_posts` directory) about what you hope to take away from or experience in 6.1040 this semester. You can replace the placeholder post or make a new post.
8. Replace the placeholder text in the title, footer, etc. of the website (hint: see `_config.yml`). Feel free to play around with the theme and customize your website to make it your own!

## Advice
1. Read [this introduction to website builders like Jekyll](https://61040-fa22.github.io/pages/site-builders) to familiarize with the concepts that power Jekyll. 
2. [This Jekyll installation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fmutMEHFMKh15WmDqWd0oqi82sIeid9DjB95oUBjAUw/edit#) walks you through the steps needed to setup Jeykll on your machine and create and deploy your site.
3. Check that your website not only runs locally but also works when deployed.

## Submission

For this assignment only, you will submit your website URL via [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/s7qWBBJQJkp2Z3ha7). For future assignments, there will be no explicit submission process, and TAs will revisit your URL to find your work. For more information on the submission process, please see the corresponding section of the [class guide](https://61040-fa22.github.io/about/).
