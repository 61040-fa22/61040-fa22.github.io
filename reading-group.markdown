As the [class guide](https://61040-fa22.github.io/about/) says, this class includes an optional design reading group. A new book, [*The Essence of Software*](https://essenceofsoftware.com/), on which much of the class material is based, is a *recommended* but not required text. For students interested in delving more deeply into the ideas of the class, Daniel Jackson will host an optional weekly discussion group about software design based on assigned readings mostly from the book. Pizza will be served.

The reading group meets weekly on Thursdays from 5 to 6 pm. The location will be 32-370 every week except on Sep 15, which will be 32-G575, and Sep 29, which will be 32-D507.
