**Daniel Jackson (Lecturer)**

I’m a prof of computer science. I research software design, with a focus on usability, safety, privacy and security. I love teaching and engaging with students. This class was first taught in 2011. Its origins are in 6.170, a project class that Barbara Liskov and John Guttag taught (and that I TA’d!) back in the 1980s. Over the last few years, Arvind and I have been boosting the design component of the class, which is our passion (as 6.031 has covered more of the basic tech). When I’m not teaching or doing research, I’m taking photos ([https://dnj.photo](https://dnj.photo)).

**Shuli Jones (TA)**

Hi, I’m Shuli (they/them)! I graduated last spring and am now an MEng student doing my thesis with Professor Satyanarayan on making data visualizations more accessible. In my spare time, I like to read (anything but especially SFF) and do different kinds of puzzles. I’m really excited to be TAing this class and I’m very much here for anything that you need.

**Kathryn Jin (TA)**

Hi! I’m Kathryn, an MEng student at MIT. I took a version of this class in my junior year, and I enjoyed it so much that I was inspired to pursue UROPs, and now an MEng, in HCI research. After graduation, I plan on going into software engineering and applying what I’ve learned in the industry setting. I love the kind of design thinking that we get to practice in this class. For those reasons, I’m excited and honored to be able to TA for this class this semester. I’m also so excited to get to know you and support you in any way I can :)

**Mufaro Makiwa (UTA)**

Hi, I’m Mufaro and I am a senior majoring in 6-2.  I took 6.1040 (6.170) last year and it’s easily one of my favorite classes at MIT. Outside of school, I love watching and playing soccer, binge watching TV shows, and learning my favorite instrument, bass guitar. I am really looking forward to working with you all this semester, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

**Zachary Deng (UTA)**

Hi, I’m Zachary, a junior in 6-3 and 18. I really enjoy designing and writing software and plan on being a software engineer after graduation. In my free time I enjoy playing card and board games. I’m looking forward to meeting and working with you this semester.

**Jaeyoon Song (TA)**

Hi, I’m Jaeyoon, a PhD student at Sloan School of Management. I do social computing research in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). I took 6.170 last year and it is one of my favorite classes at MIT. I love designing and writing software, and am very excited to TA for this class. I look forward to working with you all!

**Kailey Yang (UTA)**

Hi! I’m Kailey, and I’m a senior majoring in 6-14. I’ve always enjoyed programming and helping others, and I was an LA for a few other course 6 classes in previous semesters. In my free time, I like reading, card games, and walking around the city to explore. I’m excited to meet everyone and to be a UTA this semester!

**Annie Zhang (TA)**

Hi, I’m Annie! I graduated last year and am now MEnging at MIT. I took this class last fall and it’s genuinely become my favorite class at MIT. I loved that 6.1040 encouraged me to think about design in a deeper, more rigorous way, which has affected the way I approach applications I come across and projects in industry. Outside of class, I like taking film photos, identifying trees, playing the guitar, and learning how to cook for others (fingers crossed). I’m super excited to get to know you all and support your growth this fall!

**Victor Luo (UTA)**

Hi, I'm Victor, a senior in courses 6-3 and 18. I took this class last fall, enjoyed designing applications with my teammates, and even took some insights into my internship last summer! I also do square dancing with Tech Squares, and head the MIT osu! club. Looking forward to working with you all!
