**Grading**. The various components of the final project grade are shown in the table. Note that 50% of the grade is assigned to design work; 35% implementation work; 10% to user testing; and 5% to team management issues.

Usually all members of a team will receive the same grade, but we reserve the right to adjust individual team members' grades based on distribution of work, participation in meetings, and understanding of the design. For each deadline, there will be no slack days and a 10% penalty for each day late turning in an assignment. No late handin for the final submission is possible.

**Notes**. Each of the tasks and deliverables will be explained in detail in a document for each phase. To help you plan, a few details are worth knowing in advance. Mentoring meetings with your TA mentors will happen weekly, at a mutually convenient time. The alpha release is due just three days after the convergent design is due, on the day before Thanksgiving. This is intended to ensure that you make a productive start on your coding before the holiday and are then able to take vacation for the rest of that week. For the alpha release itself, only minimal functionality will be required.
