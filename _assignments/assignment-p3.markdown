## Deliverables

The alpha release is 5% of your grade and will be graded as a check for completion (just like the A5/A6 milestones). To get credit, you need to have one concept fully implemented, with backend RESTful routes, a Vue frontend, and a working deployment. We are not expecting any kind of styling or layout (as a guide, styling similar to the starter code is completely fine). Which concept you choose, and whether it is an innovative concept or one you are reusing from A5/A6, is up to you. (Throughout the project, you're free to reuse any starter code or code that your team members wrote for the individual assignments.) Remember that we are not offering extensions on project deadlines and no matter what concept you implement for the alpha, you will have to implement all of your concepts in time for the beta release.

## Submission
To turn in the alpha release, submit the [final project deliverable form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfyJBcskVdzJDY9NrwMyIf_fE3q8-Skcd5I_RubUDILHXyyw/viewform?usp=sf_link) once for your whole team by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, November 23rd. The form will ask you to include links to your working deployment and the Git repo you are deploying from.
